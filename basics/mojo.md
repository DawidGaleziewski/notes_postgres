Before you begin this quiz, I would like to take a moment to explain my general philosophy on quizzes and learning.

It is my intention for quizzes in this course to serve as opportunities for self-learning. If you get a question wrong, I encourage you to think about this as a kind of problem to be solved, and an opportunity for you to grow. A wrong answer is not an indication that you are a “bad programming student” - even the most successful programmers get questions wrong! 

So, if you do get a question wrong, or if you are unsure why you got a question right, I encourage you to do the following: 

Reflect on the quiz question and the answer you gave. Consider what made this question confusing for you. Was there a specific topic, word, or process that was difficult? Write these ideas down as you think about them.

Review the previous lectures in this course and take notes. Re-watching lectures with the intention of solving a problem is a different experience than the first time watching a lecture. You will usually notice things that slipped by your first time watching.

Review the discussion forums. Understand that you are certainly not the only learner who is confused on a certain question. You may find some comments in the discussion forums helpful, but also understand that not every discussion post is accurate. 

Look for other resources available online or at your local library. It is usually helpful to get different perspectives on difficult topics. You may find that someone else has explained the topic in a way that makes perfect sense to you. And that’s great! You could consider sharing that resource in the discussion forums to benefit you and your peers. 

After you’ve made an honest effort to do the steps outlined above, I am confident that you will be a better programmer. Even if you still don’t understand the original quiz question, you will likely have learned something else along the way, and you will have engaged in the kind of learning process that successful programmers use all the time. 


Cheers!
